# Handling databases with SQL

## Structured Query Language

*SQL* is a declarative query language maintained by the *ISO* organization which was
designed to deal with relational databases systems and most commonly structured
data.

As it is, above all, a language with its own structures, depending on what
kind of database is being used you'll have different syntax and semantics in
according to each management systems, such as *PostgreSQL*, *MySQL*, and so
forth, although they all are based upon the same originâ€”the SQL language.
